00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.720
Can we talk about how we can solve this

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.560
customer's issue?I got some ideas. Yeah,

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.600
sounds great. Let's do that. Here are

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.160
my ideas. So number one that we should

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.400
make sure that. When you are in a

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.360
conversation, do you listen or just

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.320
wait for your turn to talk?How often are

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.440
you actually thinking about nothing else

9
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.200
other than words coming out from the

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.840
other person's mouth?Probably not

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.800
often. And you're not alone.

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.760
Research shows that the average person

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.640
listens at only about 25%

14
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.320
efficiency. While

15
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.160
most people agree that listening

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.040
effectively is crucial, most people don't

17
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.360
feel a strong need to improve their own

18
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.240
skill level. Verbal communication

19
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.600
is essential in daily life, but it's

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.520
especially important in your career. From

21
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.520
your first job interview to your weekly

22
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.920
meetings,You need to understand and

23
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.320
retain what your colleagues, bosses, and

24
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.280
clients are telling you. Active listening

25
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520
helps you collaborate more effectively,

26
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.120
reduce misunderstandings, improve

27
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.320
productivity, and all of these are

28
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.400
necessary for workplace success.

29
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080
Wait, so how can I improve my active

30
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.040
listening skill?I'm glad you asked.

31
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.840
Here are three quick tips to help you get

32
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.360
started: Number one is to pay

33
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.280
attention. It means to pay attention

34
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.680
to the speaker and not your own thoughts.

35
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640
Number two is to show that you are

36
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.120
listening. For example, have eye

37
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.680
contact. Number three is

38
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.160
paraphrasing. This tests your

39
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.480
understanding of what is heard so that

40
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.720
you can reflect the speaker's thoughts in

41
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.600
your own words. For example, you can

42
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.680
say, I think you are saying that.

43
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.960
Or, Do you mean this?When you

44
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.120
ask questions like this, you help the

45
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.360
speaker know what you understand or don't

46
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.320
understand, in which case they can

47
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.120
clarify for you. Active

48
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.680
listening calls for receiving

49
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.280
information, processing it, and then

50
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.840
giving feedback to the speaker

51
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.680
respectfully. And this isn't always

52
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.400
easy. However, it's really all

53
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.720
about shutting down distractions, being

54
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.120
present, and not being afraid of silence

55
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.440
or disagreement. You can do this.
